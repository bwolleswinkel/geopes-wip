    - Gabriel: Hmm might be tricky, as there's many definition; he used quadratic cones, of the form x^T Q x < 0
    - Gabriel: I actually have some checks for (quadratic) cones, might be interesting to look at

### TODO: Look into (polytopic) cones, which are cone(ray_1, ray_2, ..., ray_k), i.e., the positive combinations of the rays as in the Minkowski-Weyl theorem

### FIXME: What convention do we want for separate constructors? Do we want to use classmethods, like pandas? So we can have:
    poly = geo.poly_from_verts(verts)  # More similar to numpy?
    poly = geo.verts_to_poly(verts)
    poly = geo.verts_2_poly(verts)
    poly = geo.verts2poly(verts)
    poly = geo.Polytope.from_verts(verts)  # @classmethod, used in pandas
which one is best?
# FROM: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/iy3rdl/classmethod_when_to_use_it/

### FIXME: Should we use abbreviations, and when? For instance, we can have:
    V_star = geo.control.min_inv_sub(...)  # NOTE: NumPy also uses the full name, i.e., `numpy.linalg.inv` and `numpy.random.rand`
    V_star = geo.ctrl.min_inv_subspace(...)  # Should we use abbreviations only for methods?

### FIXME: Should we also have functions as follows:
    X = geo.poly(F, g)  # Instead of `geo.Polytope(F, g)`
    X = geo.zono(G, c)  # Instead of `geo.Zonotope(G, c)`
    E = geo.ellipsoid(A, b)  # Instead of `geo.Ellipsoid(A, b)`
    # This is similar to how `numpy` does it, i.e., `np.array(...)`, or `control.ss(A, B, C, D)` instead of `control.StateSpace(A, B, C, D)`.

### FIXME: Should we name the package 'geopes' or 'pespy'? Geo stands for geometry, but could also be confused with geography. Examples would be:
    X = geo.poly(F, g)  # Geo for geometry
    X = pp.poly(F, g)  # Pes for polytope, ellipsoid, subspace

### FIXME: As Gabriel said, storing vertices in high dimesnions, e.g., 1000, is prohibitive as they grow exponentially (the number of them)

### TODO: In a `config.py` file, apart from `RTOL` and `ATOL`, we need to also have a function `set_print_options`, which sets the print options for numpy, scipy, and maybe also for cvxpy (if possible). Also, maybe add a `verbose` flag in there as well? And have everything use `config.VERBOSE`!

### TODO: For lazy properties, check out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3012421/python-memoising-deferred-lookup-property-decorator, they have a `@lazy_property` decorator

### TODO: Also check out the walrus operator `:=`, https://realpython.com/python-walrus-operator/, which can be really clean for local variables and flags in loops

### TODO: Check out the following documentation on how to properly overwrite the ufunc method for numpy arrays, by setting `__array_ufunc__ = None` Also has a full list of operators and names!
# FROM: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/neps/ufunc-overrides.html

### TODO: For the `reduce` or `minimal` representation, where we remove redundant vertices or half-spaces, check out the following tow sources:
- # FROM: https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~fukuda/soft/polyfaq/node23.html#polytope:Vredundancy2

    Examples
    --------
    This is an example how the algorithm works.
    Step 0: V = {[1, 1], [2, 3]}  # Given vertices
    Step 1: As the polytope P is conv(V), it must hold that:
    lmd_1 + lmd_2 = 1
    lmd_1 * [1, 1] + lmd_2 * [2, 3] = [x_1, x_2]
    lmd_1, lmd_2 >= 0
    Step 2: Use the Fourier-Motzkin elimination to eliminate lmd_1 and lmd_2, resulting in the (in)equalities:
    2 * x_1 - x_2 == 1
    1 <= x_1 <= 2
    Step 3: Convert the equalities to inequalities (actually, we don't want to do that), resulting in the H-representation:
